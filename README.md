# Introduction to MIMO Communications by Hampton - Code Repository

## Overview
This repository comprises all the code files associated with the problems present in each chapter of the book "Introduction to MIMO Communications" by Jerry R. Hampton. The repository is designed to provide practical insights to readers who are looking to understand the theories presented in the book and apply them in real-world scenarios.

Each chapter in the book has been assigned a separate directory which includes the corresponding code files. The code files are written and tested meticulously, providing users an efficient way to understand the complex concepts of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications.

## Structure
The repository is structured as follows: 

- Each code corresponds to a chapter in the book, named as `Chapter1`, `Chapter2`, etc.

## Disclaimer
While utmost care has been taken to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the code, there may be some unintentional errors. If you encounter any issues, please raise an issue or submit a Pull Request with the fix.

## Acknowledgments
I want to express my sincere gratitude to Hampton, the author of "Introduction to MIMO Communications," for the comprehensive theoretical insights, which this repository is based on.

Enjoy learning MIMO Communications!
